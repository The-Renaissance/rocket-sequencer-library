#Attention to those who stumpled upon here
This is a crude Arduino-based rocket action scheduling framework that I wrote back in 2016 being a member of CUInSpace to help other developers to schedule actions executed by their code while learning to program on the platform for the first time. Unfortunately due to time constraints it did not see action. In the next year we moved on to another non-Arduino based AVR platform, and the guy in charge had a different idea for scheduling an event. Since then, it has been forgotten at some corner in my laptop.

Since it was the first time I programmed on an Arduino, it probably contained a lot of coding errors and bugs.
